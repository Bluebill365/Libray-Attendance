#Library Attendance

A library attendance or logging system, digitally record and manage student attendance within a library environment,
The system uses a QR code scanning to log students visits, manage active sessions, and provide administrators with accurate daily and semester data. 

Core Idea is to let students scan a QR Code at the entrance of the library using a mobile application,
This action initiates a login process that records their presence. Library administrators manage and monitor all student sessions through a dedicated web based admin panel.
